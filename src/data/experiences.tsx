                My first role was with AST Group as part of an apprenticeship
                program. Initially hired as a software tester, I took on dual
                responsibilities, including a secondary role as a network
                engineer. I was responsible for maintaining the in-house servers
                used for development and testing.
                <br />
                <br />
                At AST, I worked closely with developers who guided me into
                software development. One of my additional tasks was creating
                unit tests in C# to expedite the development process. I also
                developed automated UI tests using the Selenium framework and
                Python, which provided an efficient system for end-to-end
                testing, significantly reducing manual effort with each release.
                <br />
                <br />
                During my time at AST, I primarily worked on IRIS, an asset
                tracking solution that enables accurate tracking and
                communication with satellite devices. Testing the compatibility
                of various devices with IRIS allowed me to gain a comprehensive
                understanding of how these devices operate. This experience also
                gave me valuable insights into different network types and data
                transfer methods.

                I joined SupplyPoint as a junior full-stack developer, initially
                focusing on bug fixes for various REST APIs. This role was a
                significant learning experience, providing me with foundational
                knowledge in effective teamwork within a software development
                environment and the skills to work with existing codebases.
                <br />
                <br />
                A few months into my tenure, I was tasked with redesigning the
                UI for the machines produced by SupplyPoint. This project was a
                great opportunity to apply the React skills I had been
                developing in my personal time. I proposed using React for the
                new UI, and the team embraced the idea. Consequently, the new
                interface was built on React and integrated into a Windows
                desktop application using Electron.
                <br />
                <br />
                SupplyPoint was my first developer role, marking an essential
                milestone in my career progression. It was here that I began
                working extensively with technologies that I now specialize in.

                I joined Toob as an Application Systems Specialist, taking on a
                variety of responsibilities in a fast-growing startup
                environment. My primary role involved creating and maintaining
                extensions for a third-party software used to manage both the
                network and customer interactions. These extensions were
                developed using C# and JavaScript.
                <br />
                <br />
                In addition to my main tasks, I integrated an ACS (Auto
                Configuration Server) to remotely manage customer CPE (Customer
                Premises Equipment), enhancing the support staff's ability to
                deliver superior customer service. I also developed an extension
                for the management software, allowing the ACS to be accessed
                directly from the same platform. This integration enabled
                support staff to provide comprehensive support from a single
                interface, improving efficiency and user experience.
                <br />

                At Toob, I played a significant role in the design process,

                ensure the software met its intended purposes and various use
                cases. This position marked my first major involvement in
                design, providing valuable insights into client-focused software
                development.

                At North Sails, I worked as a Full Stack Developer, contributing
                to the development and maintenance of an internal sales and
                stock management system. This system was built using a C# and
                .NET Core REST API and a ReactJS frontend with MaterialUI. Upon
                joining, I focused on converting the existing REST API from VB
                to the more modern .NET Core framework. Additionally, I upgraded
                numerous outdated pages, transitioning them to React and
                developing new pages to enhance functionality.
                <br />
                <br />
                Given the small development team, consisting of just myself and
                one other person, I had ample opportunities to contribute to
                both the design and development of the software. One of the
                interesting projects I planned and prototyped was a mobile app
                for scanning QR codes to aid in stock management during the sail
                production process.
                <br />
                <br />
                During my time at North Sails, I honed valuable skills such as
                refactoring code logically and comprehensively. This role also
                allowed me to apply my TypeScript knowledge in a professional
                setting for the first time. Moreover, I became proficient at
                presenting large amounts of data in a user-friendly manner.

                I joined Dootrix as a Full-Stack Developer, assisting multiple
                teams in building and maintaining various client projects.
                Throughout my tenure, I utilized a range of technologies
                including C#, .NET Core, and JavaScript to develop systems such
                as REST APIs and user-friendly interfaces. One notable project
                involved implementing a cache system for a car valuation tool,
                enabling users to return to previously checked vehicle data.
                <br />
                <br />
                Dootrix was my first experience working in a dedicated software
                house, offering a unique dynamic where my work was driven by
                diverse client needs rather than a single company's objectives.
                I also participated in a small internal project, where each
                employee chose a new technology to explore. I selected Xamarin
                and developed a collection management system for Pok√©mon cards,
                which proved to be a fun and challenging endeavor.

                within political parties. This system was developed using a
                .NET-based REST API and Next.js. My role involved end-to-end
                development of features, starting from the database and
